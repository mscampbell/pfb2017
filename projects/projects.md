## PnP
### Description
You awaken in a dark prison cell without any recollection of how you got there. In order to escape and solve the mystery of your incarceration, you -- the user -- must maneuver to solve riddles, fight creatures, and avoid making bad decisions as you encounter a series of questionable characters in this sassy adventure game.

This project strengthened and broadened the students' Python programming skills via the writing and demo'ing of a text-based (in-terminal) adventure game. The students gained valuable skills in software design and collaborative coding with Git version control.
